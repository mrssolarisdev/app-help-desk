# Help desk app

# The app
Basic PHP prototype called "App Help Desk" created as a proof of concept. Designed without using a database, where the data is collected from a ordinary file, just for training.

# Content
The project contains both the [**private**](https://github.com/mrssolarisdev/app-help-desk/tree/main/helpdesk%20(htdocs)) and the [**public**](https://github.com/mrssolarisdev/app-help-desk/tree/main/app_help_desk%20(private)) folder of the site. The [**private**](https://github.com/mrssolarisdev/app-help-desk/tree/main/helpdesk%20(htdocs)) folder contains content accessible only by scripts inside the [**public**](https://github.com/mrssolarisdev/app-help-desk/tree/main/app_help_desk%20(private)) directory or by scripts in the [**private**](https://github.com/mrssolarisdev/app-help-desk/tree/main/helpdesk%20(htdocs)) folder itself.

# Running
The site consists of a login screen where both the user and admins can authenticate in order to access the functions of the platform. Once logged in, the site provides some pages with options, where the users can open a support call and in case of an admin, visualize the open calls.
